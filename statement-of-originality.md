## Declaration
  I declare that everything that I have submitted in this assignment is entirely my own work, with the following exceptions:

In the fields below, replace 'N/A' with appropriate words, in case this applies
to you.  'N/A' stands for 'Not Applicable', which implies that this does not
apply to you (this is the default).  IF this does not apply to you, then leave the 'N/A' as is.


Add as many "url+licence+comment" entries as necessary

### Code: [i.split(',', 1)[0] for i in total_cwe] for Qn3b
If you copied (or slightly changed) code from a friend or external website (for example), you must reference it here. Even if you change the variable name or slightly change the functions, it must still be referenced here.


  - comment: This line of code is in Qn3b when I was trying to get all cwe ids and to seperate some of the combined ids.
